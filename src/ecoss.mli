val data_sets_dir : unit -> string
(** [data_sets_dir ()] is a directory where data sets are stored.
    By default, it is "./data" but this value can be overriden
    using the environment variable [$ECOSS_DATASETS] or by calling
    [set_data_sets_dir] *)

val set_data_sets_dir : string -> unit
(** Define [data_sets_dir ()]. *)

val initialize : unit -> unit
(** [initialize ()] ensures that [data_sets_dir ()] contains the
    up-to-date data sets that [ecoss] can handle. It also loads
    several index in memory. This function is automatically called
    during startup. Yet, it can be called again to refresh the
    state of the library, typically when [data_sets_dir ()] has
    been changed by external means. *)
